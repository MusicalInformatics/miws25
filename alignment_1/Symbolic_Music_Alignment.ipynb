    "Music representations, since this is a tutorial on symbolic music processing, we will focus on symbolic music representations, such that can be stored in formats such as MIDI, MusicXML or MEI, and that can be generated by editors like MuseScore, Finale, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Audio vs. Symbolic Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "* In **Audio-based alignment**, the alignment itself typically refers to  of *timestamps* (in absolute time in seconds) in one audio recording of a musical work to the corresponding *timestamp* in another recording. (In audio recordings, identifying individual notes is not a trivial task)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* In **Symbolic-based alignment**, we can have two types of alignment:\n",
    "    * **Time-wise alignments**: similar to audio-based alignment, we can map timestamps (in symbolic time units like musical beats or MIDI ticks) from one version of the work to another (e.g., a MIDI performance to a score in MusicXML/MEI/Humdrum format).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Note-wise alignment**: We can map individual symbolic music elements (most commonly notes) from one version to another. This is very useful for modeling expressive performance.\n",

    "* **Offline**: Alignment of two *recordings/documents* (i.e., audio recordings, MIDI performances, MusicXML scores, etc.). These recordings/documents can be in any of the modalities described above, the important thing being that the music is occurring in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Online**: Alignment of a live (i.e., real time) performance to the music encoded in a target document (e.g., a pre-annotated audio recording, a symbolic score, etc.).

    "## 3. Alignment Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We move now to methods for computing the alignment between features from one version of a piece of music to another. Common methods are dynamic programming approaches like dynamic time warping (DTW) and probabilistic approaches like hidden Markov models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Alignments with Dynamic Time Warping.\n",
    "\n",
    "DTW is a dynamic programming algorithm to find the **optimal** alignment between to time-dependent sequences. In a nutshell, the DTW algorithm finds the alignment between two sequence in three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the pairwise distance between elements in sequence $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\mathbf{Y}$.\n",
    "2. Compute the accumulated cost matrix\n",
    "3. Find the best alignment by backtracking \n",
    "\n",

    "## 4 Music Alignment with DTW\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Computation**: Compute features from score and the performance (in this case the piano rolls)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time-wise Alignment**: Compute the alignment between the sequences of features using DTW. This produces a time-wise alignment that tells us which time in the performance (in seconds) corresponds to which time in the score (in musical beats).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Note-level Alignment**: To get a note-level alignment, we match notes in the performance to notes in the score considering the time-wise alignment, and matching notes greedily by pitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Time Warping and related sequence alignment algorithms return a path between two sequences or time series. Note alignment of two polyphonic parts is categorically different from a time series alignment. To get to a note alignment, we need to figure out what notes are played at a specific time in the piano roll. Sometimes this information might be imprecise so we need to relax the search for notes at some piano roll time to find all relevant notes."
